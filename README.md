# üöÄ Radarr to Plex Collections üçø

Welcome to Radarr to Plex Collections! Say goodbye to scattered movies and hello to organized collections, all with the click of a button (or command)!

## üé• About

Plex attempts automatically create collections (if you have that setting enabled), but is inconsistent at best and does nothing at worst. Radarr to Plex Collections automates the process of creating Plex movie collections directly from your existing Radarr movie collections, streamlining your media management experience. 


## ‚ùì What are plex collections?

Plex collections allow you to organize your media library by grouping related movies together. These collections are visible in the Plex interface under the "Collections" tab within a movie library, making it easy to browse and access movies within each collection. Additionally, within each movie's details in Plex, the collection it belongs to is displayed, providing a convenient way to watch movies in order or explore related content.

## üåü Features

- **Automated Collection Creation**: Radarr to Plex Collections seamlessly generates movie collections in Plex based on your existing collections in Radarr.

    > **Note:** This application will not work for movies that are not managed in Radarr. For example, if you have three Harry Potter movies in Plex that are not managed by Radarr, they will not be added to the Harry Potter Collection.

- **Effortless Automation**: With Radarr to Plex Collections, automate the entire process effortlessly. Set it up once, and let the tool handle the rest. Save time and effort by automating the management of your collections seamlessly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Using Radarr to Plex Collections is a breeze:

1. **Configure Settings**: Open the `config.json` file and provide your Radarr and Plex server details.
    - **RadarrURL**: Replace `"your_radarr_url_here"` with the URL of your Radarr instance. This typically looks like `http://localhost:7878` unless you've configured it differently.
    - **RadarrAPIKey**: Replace `"your_radarr_api_key_here"` with your Radarr API key. You can find this in Radarr under Settings > General > Security.
    - **PlexURL**: Replace `"your_plex_url_here"` with the URL of your Plex instance. This typically looks like `http://localhost:32400`.
    - **PlexToken**: Replace `"your_plex_token_here"` with your Plex authentication token. To obtain the token, follow these steps:
        1. Log in to your Plex account in the Plex Web App.
        2. Browse to any library item in your Plex server.
        3. Select "Get Info" on the library item.
        4. Select View XML button on the Get Info page.
        5. View the URL of the xml and locate the value associated with the `X-Plex-Token` parameter (usually at the end of the URL).
        6. Copy the value of the `X-Plex-Token` parameter (value after =) and paste it into the `PlexToken` field in your `config.json` file. 
        7. Save and close the confif file.
    - **MinForCollection**: Set `"MinForCollection"` to the minimum number of movies required to create a collection. For example, if you set it to `2`, collections will only be created when you have 2 or more movies in that collection in your Plex library.
    - **LibraryName**: Replace `"library_name_here"` with the name of the library in Plex for which you want to create collections. This will most likely be named "Movies".
    - **DeleteExistingPlexCollections**: Acceptable values are `true` or `false`. If set to true the application will delete all pre-existing collections within plex. It is advised to set to true if Plex auto-generated some collections as this application may generate a duplicate collection with a slightly different name. Keep in Mind this will delete any collections you created manually as well.
    - **Exclusions**: Optionally, fill out the `"Exclusions"` array with the names of collections you want to exclude from synchronization.

## üîç Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and suggested solutions:

- **401 Unauthorized Error**: If you encounter a 401 Unauthorized error, double-check your API key for Radarr and Plex. Ensure that the API keys provided in the `config.json` file are correct and properly configured with the required permissions.

- **Application Not Running**: If the application fails to run, verify that the executable file (`RadarrToPlex` or `RadarrToPlex.exe`) has the appropriate permissions to execute. You may need to adjust the file permissions using the `chmod` command on Linux/macOS.

- **Empty Plex Collections**: If Plex collections are not created or appear empty, ensure that your Radarr library contains movies with associated collections. Collections will only be created in Plex for movies that are managed within Radarr.

- **Schedule Not Working**: If the scheduled task fails to run as expected, review the task scheduler settings to ensure that the task is configured correctly with the appropriate start time, frequency, and working directory.
